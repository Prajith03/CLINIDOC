  Doctor: Good morning. How are you feeling today?
  Patient: Not great, doctor. I've been having these headaches for about two weeks now.
  Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the headaches for me?
  Patient: They're usually on one side of my head, throbbing, and sometimes I feel nauseous.
  Doctor: How often do they occur?
  Patient: Almost daily now, and they last for hours.
  Doctor: Any history of migraines in your family?
  Patient: Yes, my mother had them.
  Doctor: Are there any triggers you've noticed?
  Patient: Stress definitely makes them worse. And bright lights.
  Doctor: Let me check your vitals. Your blood pressure is 130/85, which is slightly elevated. Temperature is normal at 98.6°F.
  Doctor: I'm going to examine your head and neck now. Any tenderness here?
  Patient: Yes, especially on the right side.
  Doctor: I believe you're experiencing migraine headaches. Let's discuss treatment options.

Headaches occur almost daily and last for hours. Patient notes that stress and bright lights seem to trigger or worsen the headaches. Family history positive for migraines (mother).",
  objective:
    "Vital signs: BP 130/85 mmHg, temperature 98.6°F. Physical examination reveals tenderness on palpation of the right temporal region. No focal neurological deficits observed.",
  assessment:
    "Migraine headaches, likely with genetic predisposition. Triggers identified include stress and photosensitivity.",
  plan: "1. Start sumatriptan 50mg at onset of headache, may repeat after 2 hours if needed, not to exceed 200mg in 24 hours. 2. Lifestyle modifications including stress management techniques and avoiding bright light when possible. 3. Maintain headache diary to identify additional triggers. 4. Follow-up in 4 weeks to assess treatment efficacy.",
